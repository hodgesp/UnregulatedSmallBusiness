Policy Driven Risk Reduction in Unregulated Small Business Cloud Environments

During the past decades, computing infrastructure has made seismic shifts: from a server in a closet, to collocated data centers, to dedicated data centers, and to the latest frontier of the cloud. In this process, large organizations have had teams of engineers working to maintain and secure their infrastructure, but small businesses do not have the capability to match this level of staffing. Where large enterprise teams have hundreds of employees working on applications and infrastructure projects, a small business may have a team of just a few supporting custom, in-house applications and off the shelf solutions in addition to the infrastructure required to operate. In this light, I am to create a set of actionable security policies that can be applied across public cloud providers in an automated fashion. These policies, driven by a analysis of known attacks and a threat model of possible attack vectors, aims to help small business who are not required to be compliant with regulations such as Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) or under the regulation of European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). This is a starting point for businesses who may have limited or no policies nor methods to automate enforcement of policies by leveraging solutions that can be applied to disparate public cloud providers.

To use, simply download each folder as required for your cloud environment. It is recommended to use Windows Subsystem for Linux or another Bash environment.
You will also need Steampipe and the associated platform plugin (one each for AWS, Azure, and GCP) and Terraform installed as well as the appropriate CLI tool(s) such as AzureCLI or AWS tools.
After downloading, cd into the appropriate folder and enter 'terraform init' to ensure you are authenticated.
Next enter 'terraform plan' to view the outcome of the changes and finally 'terraform apply' to make these changes in your cloud environment.

Note: you can use 'terraform apply -destroy' to remove deployed resources

After getting confirmation of deployment, you can use Steampipe to check the security status of your environment.
To use the CIS benchmarks, simply run 'steampipe check benchmark.cis_v140' for response sent to the console or use 'steampipe check benchmark.cis_v140 > output.txt' to save the results for review.
